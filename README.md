## Contributing Guide

### All Contributions Are Reviewed!  
We welcome contributions but ask that you follow these guidelines:

1. No Stolen Code ('Skidding'): Ensure that all contributions are original. We do not accept code taken from other projects (e.g., LawinserverV2).

2. Focus on Incremental Changes: As this is also a learning project, we ask that you avoid making overly complex or significant changes that are beyond the current level of understanding. Smaller, meaningful changes are appreciated!

3. Avoid Deleting Core Code: Please refrain from removing large portions of the existing codebase. Certain sections may be integral to the backendâ€™s functionality, and deleting them could break core features.

### Tips for Contributing:  
- Create a New Branch: Always create a new branch for your contributions (e.g., feature/[feature-name]).  
- Submit Small Changes: Small bug fixes, documentation improvements, and new features are highly encouraged.  
- Respect the Learning Process: Keep changes manageable and easy to review to help keep the project maintainable.

Thank you for contributing to the project!
